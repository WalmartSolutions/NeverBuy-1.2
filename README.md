# Why?

Someone sent this in DiObfuskator discord server so I decided to gass it instead. The fact that this used qProtect makes even even funnier since it is one of the worst obfuscator on the entire Java Obfuscation market and yall have seen how Prestige client ended up with that LMAO (Deobfuscated and Buildable). Also this client is fully in russian so yeah.

# How To Use
1. Download the Fabric installer from [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/), open it and choose Minecraft 1.16.5 & Fabric Loader 0.15.X
2. Download lithium-fabric-mc1.16.5-0.6.6_7.jar (NeverBuy) from this repository along with [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/version/0.42.0+1.16) page and put it into your .minecraft/mods folder
3. Start the game (with Fabric)
